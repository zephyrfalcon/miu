TODO:

- handle data
- handle unrecognized opcodes (i.e. raise an error)
- if there's only one version of an opcode, allow omitting the /mode
- parse strings like "LDA #$01"
- conversely, translate terms like lda(0x01)/immediate to "LDA #$01"
- refactor
- command line interface

- all of the stuff currently in miu.pl is basically the assembler code, which
  can go in a separate module. miu.pl can then be the main program that takes
  input (in various forms) and produces output.

- split up tests
